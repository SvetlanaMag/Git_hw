JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript
language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content
production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins or any kind of
other extension.
